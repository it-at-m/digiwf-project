In an agile environment, we want a selection of patterns and technologies - including building blocks - to be provided that enable developers to build exactly the low-code functionality that is needed in the organization at that moment. That is the goal of DigiWF. We do not provide a proprietary out-of-box solution that is customized, but enable a development organization to build itself a customized solution. In doing so, we rely on reusable low-code functionalities that we make usable via BPMN and DMN. Thus, the platform can be started small and scaled quickly if required.

In an agile environment, we want a selection of patterns and technologies - including building blocks - to be made available to developers.
that enable developers to build exactly the low-code functionality that is needed at that moment in the organization. That is the goal of DigiWF. We don't provide a huge set of features (and get paid for them), of which only 10% are used, but enable a development organization to develop the low code functionalities that are needed at that moment.

This allows the platform to start small and grow (strongly) as needed.
